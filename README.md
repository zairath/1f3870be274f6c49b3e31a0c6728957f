Code Challenge for Levartech

Here on the code there are several files, the main file is index.php in the index.php the main function was built to get the access token from GMAIL.
It was create by GMAIL Project on Google Cloud API Services, where I create the project there to access the GMAIL API for sending the email.
then on the .env file got the mandatory variable for executing the email, got to email and subject of email and body of email, on there we can change what ever we want to sending the emails.
It using callback functions for getting any token so when it going to be triggered it will update the tokens.
there are 2 .sql files, one for mysql for script interaction for token on google and another one for saving every sent emails.
Thank you.
